# motion_planner
MATLAB GUI to help visualization of speed, acceleration and path profile.
Two path profles are provided and can be chosen using the pop-up (motion with calculated jerk or trapezoidal/triangular motion).
After the GUI starts it is necessary to enter start point, end point, maximum velocity, maximum acceleration and maximum jerk (if path with calculated jerk is desired).
After parameters are defined click update button and you'll get the profile.
By clicking on the reset button all graphics and values will be cleared.
